      <description>I would like to share how to automatically publish generated (dist) folder to GitHub pages with the help of CircleCI. This is not a git subtree-based solution because keeping automatically generated content in Git repo is&amp;hellip; meh.
Our pre-requisites are:
 dist folder is automatically generated by a script on CI dist folder is excluded from Git repo by .gitignore gh-pages gets auto refreshed with the latest content from dist folder on each commit  Current blog is successfully working with the same principles.</description>

      <description>And not only working. It&amp;rsquo;s fully automated with the help of CircleCI.
How it works?
 The blog files are stored on GitHub. It&amp;rsquo;s markdown. Every time I do a commit in order to create or update a page, the blog gets regenerated and published on GitHub Pages.  I spent some time configuring CircleCI to automatically publish blog&amp;rsquo;s content. I&amp;rsquo;m going to explain how to do it in the next post.</description>
