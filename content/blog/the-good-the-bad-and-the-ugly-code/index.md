|                       | Serves business needs | Does not serve business needs |
| --------------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Poor quality code** | The bad               | The ugly                      |
| **High quality code** | The good              | The ugly                      |

No matter how good your code is, if it does not serve business needs you might
consider removing it from the codebase.
