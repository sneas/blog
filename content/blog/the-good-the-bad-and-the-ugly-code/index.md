description: An easy way to see the difference between the bad and the ugly code

| | Serves business needs | Does not serve business needs |
|---|---|---|
| **Poor quality code** | The bad | The ugly |
| **High quality code** | The good | The ugly | 

The point is no matter how good your code is, if it does not serve business needs you might
consider removing it from the codebase.
