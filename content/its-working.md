And not only working. It's fully automated with the help of [CircleCI](https://circleci.com).

How it works?

* The blog files are [stored on GitHub](https://github.com/sneas/blog/tree/master/content). It's markdown.
* Every time I do a commit in order to create or update a page, the blog gets regenerated and published on GitHub Pages.

I spent some time configuring CircleCI to automatically publish blog's content. I'm going to explain how to do it in the next post.
